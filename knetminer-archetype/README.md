#Â The Knetminer archetype

This is a [Maven Archetype project][10], which helps to define new Knetminer-related projects that
contains common elements and pointers to our resources. See the [main README](../README.md) for details.  

When you generate a new Maven project with this artifact, you have a starting skeleton, which links to our
common POM (see the link above) and inherits copies of common files like the ones needed for Travis deployment
(again, see the link above).

You can easily generate a new project (ie, Maven module) from a Bash-compatible shell,
by typing something like:


```bash  	
curl -L https://tinyurl.com/knetminer-archetype-sh | sh -s uk.ac.rothamsted.knetminer sample-jar 1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

where, of course, the three parameters are the new artifact's coordinates.  

**To Windows users**: while we haven't tried it yet, we're confident that you can reproduce what the command above does
manually. That is, download this hereby archetype project as a dependency in your local Maven, 
then launch the Archetype plugins. This is simply what the [above script](create-project.sh) does.
