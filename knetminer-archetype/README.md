#Â The Knetminer archetype

This is a [Maven Archetype project][10], which helps to define new Knetminer-related projects that
contains common elements and pointers to our resources. See the [main README](../README.md) for details.  

When you generate a new Maven project with this artifact, you have a starting skeleton, which links to our
common POM (see the link above) and inherits copies of common files like the ones needed for Travis deployment
(again, see the link above).

You can easily generate a new project (ie, Maven module) from a Bash-compatible shell,
by typing something like:


```bash  	
curl -L https://tinyurl.com/knetminer-archetype-sh | sh -s uk.ac.rothamsted.knetminer sample-jar 1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

where, of course, the three parameters are the new artifact's coordinates.

The new project is a simple jar project. The common elements it contains include:

  * A [POM file][20] that inherits from our [common POM](../README), defining common third party dependencies 
  (eg, log4j2) and coordinates to download/deploy with our [team artifactory](https://knetminer.org/artifactory)
  * A [simple Travis file][30], which downloads our [common Maven settings](../settings.xml) and deploys your new 
  project on our artifactory
  * A convenience [.gitignore file][40]

**WARNING**: The default `.gitignore` files ignores `travis/*`, since our scripts download this from our repo and,
by default, it is not meant to be duplicated in derived projects.  
  

**To Windows users**: while we haven't tried it yet, we're confident that you can reproduce what the command above does
manually. That is, download this hereby archetype project as a dependency in your local Maven, 
then launch the Archetype plugins. This is simply what the [above script](create-project.sh) does.
